Introduction
============

TaskSwitchXP is an advanced task management utility that picks up where the 
standard Windows Alt-Tab switcher leaves off. It provides the same 
functionality, and adds visual styles to the dialog and also enhances it by 
displaying thumbnail preview of the application that will be switched to. 
TaskSwitchXP also has a powerful process and window management capability that 
allows you quickly to close/minimize applications and their groups. The unique 
capabilities of TaskSwitchXP make it useful for tracking down multitudinous 
windows, and provide insight into the way Windows and applications work.
